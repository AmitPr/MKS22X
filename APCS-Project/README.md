# APCS-Project

### Compiling & Running
To Compile and Run the project, navigate to the directory you cloned this repository to in your terminal, and use the commands:
```
#To Compile
javac *.java

#To Run
java ImageEditor
```

To use the program there are many commands that you can use. Using the `help` command will show a description of each command. 


To open an image in the program, when specifying a path to an image, it must be a complete path to the file such as:
```
#Windows
open "C:\Users\Name\Pictures\Test.png"
#Linux\
open "/home/name/Test.jpg"
```

Filters applied to images can be stacked to apply multiple effects.
All images saved with the `save` command are saved in the PNG format. Remember that exiting the program will not save any pictures that have not already been saved by the `save` command.
